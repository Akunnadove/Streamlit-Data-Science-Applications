### Key Steps
#### Phase 1
* Load images to be predicted
* Rescale and Explore image attributes
* Divide dataset into train, test and validation sets
* Create and fit model
* Make predictions
* Evaluate the model accuracy performance

##### Python code link 
#### Phase 2
* Develop streamlit application
* Connect saved model to application
##### User interface
