# Health-diabetes-prediction
Predict patients status as being likely diabetic or not using a classification algorithmn in python machine learning.

## Project Objectives
* Import and clean the dataset 
* Profile the data
* Find correlation between dependent and independent features
* Split data into train and test sets
* Building various machine learning model
* Save model with highest accuracy 
* Deploy model as a streamlit app
